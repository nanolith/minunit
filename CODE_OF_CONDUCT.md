Code of Conduct
===============

This is a small project, but I welcome users, collaborators, and contributors.
This software is for everyone.  All should feel welcome to use or contribute to
this software, regardless of the wide range of characteristics that make each of
us unique.

Unfortunately, my standard rule of "don't be an asshole" is not considered good
enough for the guidelines of a code of conduct.  So, I'll try to spell things
out without getting long-winded.  While I understand that discussions can
get heated at times, I expect contributors to be respectful to others. No
harassment of anyone in the community of moderators, maintainers, contributors,
or users of this software will be tolerated.

Likewise, bad behavior is unacceptable.  What constitutes bad behavior is a
subject that would make this code of conduct far too long to read.  Most of us
know it when we see it.  Trying to make an exhaustive list is a Sisyphean task
that I will not attempt.  If someone witnesses or is subject to bad behavior in
this community, including but not limited to harassment, please contact me.  I
will examine the situation and make a ruling based on my best judgment.  Bad
behavior can be subject to warnings, letters of public apology where applicable,
or banishment from this community where needed.

This code of conduct may be replaced in the future with a longer and more
organized code if the community grows to a level of complexity to warrant this,
or if we discover that this code of conduct is not working.

In closing, be respectful to each other.  Stay on topic and away from subjects
that may cause undue controversy, at least in the bounds of this community.
